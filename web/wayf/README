Download

The latest release can be downloaded from:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation
------------
1. Unpack the SWITCHwayf_binary ${VERSION}_${DATE}.zip ZIP archive into a 
   directory on a host where Apache or IIS is installed. 

2. Make a copy of the *.dist.php files
   - Copy the file config.dist.php and name it config.php 
     This is the main configuration file of the SWITCHwayf
   - Copy the file IDProvider.conf.dist.php and name it IDProvider.conf.php
     This file contains the list of Identity Providers that that can be  
     configured by hand

3. Enure that permissions for the files:
     - SProvider.metadata.php
     - IDProvider.metadata.php 
     - metadata.lock
     - $WAYFLogFile (typically /var/log/apache2/wayf.log)
   are set such that the web server user (e.g. www-data, www or httpd) has write
   permissions for them.

4. Adapt the SWITCHwayf configuration in config.php. There are comments in that
   file that should help you make suitable choices for your use case.

5. If Apache 2 is used, add the following statement to the Apache configugration:

--

Alias /SWITCHaai /#YOUR-PATH-TO#/SWITCHwayf
<Directory /#YOUR-PATH-TO#/SWITCHwayf>
    Options Indexes MultiViews
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

    <Files WAYF>
      SetHandler php5-script
      AcceptPathInfo On
    </Files>

</Directory>

--

   Alternatively, one also could rename the file 'WAYF' to 'WAYF.php'.

6. When using the embedded WAYF feature it might be necessary to add a line to 
   the Apache configuration like below in order to prevent certain web browsers 
   from not displaying the Embedded WAYF or parts of it:

--
Header set P3P "CP=\"NOI CUR DEVa OUR IND COM NAV PRE\""
--

   For that to work, the Apache header extension must also be enabled
   with a command like:

--
a2enmod headers
/etc/init.d/apache2 reload
--

   See <http://www.w3.org/P3P/> for more details on P3P.

7. Test access by calling the WAYF with a URL like:
   <https://your.host.com/path/to/WAYF>
   Use this URL as Location for your Shibboleth configuration. The WAYF
   will automatically be able to detect whether it receives a Shibboleth 
   authentication request or a Discovery Service request.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subversion access
-----------------
Check out the latest SWITHCHwayf code with:

`svn co https://subversion.switch.ch/svn/general/aai/SWITCHwayf/`

Although the code in the Subversion should be always executable, it should be 
considered unstable and not be used for production environments without prior 
testing. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

General Update Instructions
---------------------------
1. Make a backup of the directory where the currently active version of the 
   SWITCHwayf is installed, e.g. with 'cp -a SWITCHwayf SWITCHwayf.bak'

2. Get the ZIP archive of the new version and move it into the same 
   directory as the WAYF script of the currently deployed version.
   Download from: <https://forge.switch.ch/redmine/projects/wayf/files>

3. Unzip the archive, e.g. with the command 
   'unzip -d #DD# SWITCHwayf_x.y_YYYYMMDD.zip '
   This step will overwrite all files except those whose names start 
   with 'custom-'.
   Alternatively, create a new directory, move the ZIP archive in that directory,
   unzip it and then copy the config.php and all custom-.* files from the 
   current SWITCHwayf installation over to the new directory.

4. Have a look at config.dist.php and compare this file with your current
   config.php in order to identify new configuration options.
   
   > Since version 1.18 the script 'update-config.php' can be used to 
   > merge an existing configuration (from config.php) with the default
   > configuration (config.dist.php) into a new configuration file 
   > (config.new.php). This allows easily getting a clean configuration file
   > while keeping the current settings. 
   > Run the script with: `php update-config.php`
   > Ensure that the user has the necessary write privileges to create the
   > file config.new.php. Also note that all comments you might have
   > added in the current.php will not be copied over.
   
   Also compare the custom-.* files to the default-.* files that might have
   changed. Some features like the improved drop-down list require the WAYF
   to load additional javascripts. If a custom header file is missing them,
   the feature will not work.

5. Ensure that permissions for the files:
     - SProvider.metadata.php
     - IDProvider.metadata.php 
     - metadata.lock
     - $WAYFLogFile (typically /var/log/apache2/wayf.log)
   are set such that the web server user (e.g. www-data, www or httpd) has write
   permissions for them.


6. If SAML2 metadata is used by SWITCHwayf, you might have to run the following
   command to bootstrap the metadata reading process again:
   `php readMetadata.php`

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Specific Update Instructions
----------------------------

* Updates from versions before 1.18
  The following new configuration options were introduced:
  
  - $supportContactEmail
  - $organizationLogoURL
  - $organizationURL
  - $faqURL
  - $helpURL
  - $privacyURL
  
  Have a look at config.dist.php in section "5. Appearance Settings" for a 
  description on these settings. Then make sure to add them to config.php
  with your own values (or empty strings to ignore them). Otherwise, default 
  values will be set.
  The default behaviour for the Embedded WAYF setting
  wayf_use_small_logo was changed from false to true as most instances
  of the Embedded WAYF seem to prefer the small logo. All non-mandatory
  settings of the Embedded WAYF are now commented out in the default 
  template that is generated for the Embedded WAYF. This implies that
  if there are Service Providers using your Embedded WAYF feature, they might
  have to review their Embedded WAYF settings if they still want to use the
  larger logo.


* Updates from versions before 1.15
  The keys of the following languages strings were renamed and should be  
  adapted in the custom-languages.php file if it exists.
  - 'about_aai' was renamed to 'about_federation'
  - 'about_switch' was renamed to 'about_organisation'
  - 'switch_description' was renamed to 'additional_info'


* Update from versions before 1.14.3:
  The new setting '$metadataLockFile' was introduced in config.php. It allows
  configuring the location of the lock file. When the SWITCHwayf is used in a 
  Windows environment, the path to this file probably has to be adapted.


* Update from versions before 1.8:
  This version has a slightly different structure than previous versions. 
  Therefore, it is recommended to start with a clean installation. 
  However, you should be able to take over most of your old config.php 
  functions and use them in the new template.php file again to keep your 
  customized look and feel.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Security Notes
--------------
The Discovery Service protocol as defined in 
<http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-idp-discovery.pdf>
states that the protocol creates opportunities for phishing attacks as do all
SSO protocols that make use of redirection. The specification states that an 
implementation "SHOULD" examine the 'return' parameter used in a Discovery 
Service request and match it against the <idpdisc:DiscoveryResponse> 
extension in SAML metadata. Since version 1.14 the SWITCHwayf supports this 
feature. In order to activate it, the SWITCHwayf has to use the SAML 2 metadata
parsing features by using

* $useSAML2Metadata = true;

and set the options:

* enableDSReturnParamCheck = true;

and potentially

* $useACURLsForReturnParamCheck = true;

in case the metadata loaded by SWITCHwayf does not include DiscoveryResponse 
elements for many Service Providers.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Troubleshooting
---------------
Generally, if there is an error or an exception, the WAYF will log it to syslog. 
In case there is a problem and only a white page without any output is displayed, 
open config.php in a text editor, go to the bottom of the file and set:

$developmentMode = true;

This should output PHP warning messages which are otherwise supressed.

-------------
Consult the DOC file in the same directly as this file for further information 
on configuring and customizing the SWITCHwayf.
